					<h2 class="major">Multimodality</h2>
					<p>The idea of writing has changed in recent years- or should I say, the idea of
						<em>communication</em> has changed in recent years. According to guidebook authors Kristin
						Arola, Cheryl Ball and Jennifer Sheppard, there has been a shift "from a composition pedagogy
						focused exclusively on the written word to a pedagogy that includes a range of semiotic
						modes, including (but not limited to) oral, written, and visual communication." (Arola et. al)
					</p>
				</div>


				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<h2><em>Reflection Question 1: <br />Do you agree with Arola, Ball and Sheppard that there has
								indeed been such a shift in communication? Why or why not?</em></h2>
					</div>
				</div>


				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<h2 class="major">... That doesn't necessarily mean teaching many different, separate modes</h2>
						<p>In today's day and age, expanding the idea of teaching writing to this broader scope doesn't
							just imply that it's advantageous to teach about these many different modes of communication
							separatesly. In fact, learning in this way would not only help students convey their ideas
							via multiple modes of communication, it would also help them select an appropriate mode of
							communication to use.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Teachers of rhetoric, not teachers of writing.</h2>
						<p>As mentioned in the article, instructors are now being trained more as teachers of not just
							writing as a
							single medium through which we can communicate, but rather a variety of "integrated modes
							based on audience,
							purpose, and context" (Arola et. al). In other words, instructors are now trained to be
							teachers of not just
							writing, but of <em>rhetoric</em> as well.</p>

						<p>This isn't to say, however, that such ideas haven't been brought up before. An example of a
							group that toyed with this idea in the past is the New London Group (more information to the
							right)- who subscribed to this idea long before the advent of the instant communication we
							enjoy with today's internet infrastructure.</p>

						<h4>The New London Group: Early Adopters</h4>
						<h5><em>quoted from Arola et. Al</em></h5>
						<blockquote>Those who drank the kool aid, as it were, of multimodal composition tend to agree,
							whether implicitly or explicitly,
							with the New London Group (NLG)—a group of literacy scholars who greatly influenced the
							design of our Revisions course.
							The NLG could be seen as spearheading the multimodal composition turn in 1996. Their
							deceptively simple argument that
							“literacy pedagogy must now account for the burgeoning variety of text forms associated with
							information and multimedia
							technologies” essentially makes a case that such pedagogies more richly prepare students for
							the diverse rhetorical and
							communicative practices they need to succeed as students, as professionals, and as citizens
							in the 21st century. </blockquote>

						<h2 class="major">Multimodal Teaching in the 388V Classroom</h2>
						<p>At its core, multimodal teaching is very similar to regular writing instruction; new mediums
							of communication that surface over time have allowed us to effectively convey ideas in ways
							other than the age-old method of writing. That being said, it is not difficult to touch up
							the approach that 388V students take to teach the ENGL101 curriculum to make it more
							multimodality-friendly.</p>
						<p>By placing more focus on mediums that aren't the classic double spaced, Times New Roman
							academic 'paper' that college writing courses are known for, the benefits that a writing
							course can have on its students are multiplied manyfold.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<h2 class="major">Example 1: The Digital Forum</h2>
						<p>The digital forum is an assignment that's a perfect example of integrating multimodality
							instruction into our ENGL101 curriculum. Although there is a clear presence of multimodality
							in the final product, such as image choice, text placement, color selection, and more, the
							assignment is still based on writing. </p>
						<p>By providing students with a major assignment that allows them to convey ideas in a more
							experimental way, the course allows for students to put as much effort into this new type of
							assignment as they would for another paper. As such, they end up working equally hard to
							convey their ideas in this new, multimodal format, as they would for a classic college
							paper. By placing so much grade weightage on this new type of assignment, students have no
							choice but to make an effort to convey their ideas in new ways.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<h2 class="major">Example 2: The Public Remediation</h2>
						<p>The public remediation is another opportunity for students to see that there are more ways to
							effectively communicate ideas other than a classic 'college paper'. At the end of the day,
							that's what it means to properly use multimodal communication.</p>
						<p>This is a unique assignment in that it allows students to pick a medium of communication of
							their own choice, which gives students the chance to try different ways to communicate.
							Since this is the first time this assignment is being implemented (at the time of writing),
							there are no past examples to go off of. I predict, however, that students will test the
							waters by taking a few different approaches to this assignment before selecting their medium
							of choice. I believe giving them the added flexibility to not only pick what they're trying
							to convey but also <em>how they will be conveying it</em> is the key to teaching good
							multimodal communication.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>Overall, I believe these two assignments are a step in the right direction. I feel that
							although multimodal education is important, especially with present-day society's fixation
							on social media, college writing curriculum should still place an appropriate amount of
							focus on the classic 'college paper'. As such, writing (and writing instruction) in the
							digital age should definitely teach on the topic of multimodal communication, but this
							doesn't necessarily imply entire curriculums require overhauls. An excellent approach is to
							integrate assignments such as the Digital Forum &amp; Public Remediation as ways to bridge
							the gap between what sort of 'writing' students consume in their everyday lives, and what
							they produce in college.</p>

						<h2><em>Reflection Question 3: <br />As all things that involve change, opinions are always
								split between preserving the traditional way that things are carried out and the new,

					<h2 class="major">A Social Network as a Learning Network</h2>
					<p>At its very core, a social network is built to share information. The article 'A Social Network
						Can Be a Learning Network' describes how social networks can similarly be leveraged to share
						student writing, and the positive effects that this can have on their education.</p>
					<p>The article also touches upon how students can very easily find resources that they want to draw
						from. In today's day and age, students like us have gotten accustomed to browsing the web, and
						thus, we've picked up a variety of ways to pull the information that we need from the internet.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="intro span-3">
					<p>Some may argue that Social Media has allowed students to run amok, consuming fake news, being
						enveloped by distractions, and wasting their time looking for pointless validation. However,
						this article brings to light some of the overwhelming benefits of social media in our academic
						world.</p>
					<p>Students are finding increasingly innovative ways to put social media to work in producing
						meaningful academic discourse. Our job as instructors is to extract those phenomena that are
						conducive to education and emphasize them in the classroom; we should take initiative and reward
						productive behavior in this new environment.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="intro span-3">
					<h2 class="major">Back Channel Conversations</h2>
					<p>An excellent example of a phenomenon that educators such as ourselves should help cultivate would
						be the Back Channel Conversation, as explained by the Chronicle in this quote:</p>
					<blockquote>Back channels. These days it's common for academic conferences to have back-channel
						conversations. While keynote
						speakers and session leaders are speaking, audience members are sharing highlights, asking
						questions, and conversing
						with colleagues on Twitter. Some might see this as distracting, but for many it's a form of
						public note-taking and
						active listening.</blockquote>

							Since we've grown up with these mediums, we've learned how to properly use them to our
							advantage for a variety of purposes. It's taken a while, but social media is beginning to
							play a bigger role in formal education, and we have a variety of factors to thank for that,

						<h2 class="major">Students and Social Media</h2>
						<p>Before we delve into how exactly we can leverage social media for students in the college
							classroom, we should acknowledge that Social Media plays a massive part in the lives of
							students in the first place.</p>
						<p>First and foremost, students are always connected to their smartphones. As students
							ourselves, we know firsthand that we depend on our smartphones for a vast portion of our
							information, whether it be academic or not. Here, we will focus on the college-related uses
							of social media.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>According to the IDE Journal, a large portion of students leverage social media to
							communicate with faculty, complete
							homework assignments, plan study groups, and learn about campus activities. In addition, due
							to the majority of
							college students having smartphones today, social media has become an arguably integral part
							of how students form
							valuable interpersonal relationships as well.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Consequences of Social Media</h2>
						<p>Students seem to want more shared learning experiences from their professors thanks to their
							deeper involvement with social media. According to the IDE journal, their interconnectivity
							has resulted in more desires to learn from their peers rather than experts, along with more
							desires not to just memorize information, but rather to understand where to look for the
							information they need.</p>
						<p>As instructors, we have to recognize these effects that social media and the internet are
							having on our generation of students, and only by making the necessary changes to our
							curriculum to reflect what our students want, can we improve our curriculum for the better.

					<div class="content span-3">
						<h2 class="major">The Twitter Essay: Embracing New Writing Standards</h2>
						<p>Now more than ever, it's time for us educators to take into account what exactly our students
							are consuming on a daily basis, and adjust our instruction accordingly. The article, "The
							Twitter Essay", describes how students are much more comfortable writing texts and twitter
							posts, but find academic papers to be a much more daunting task, when in actuality, both are
							just ways to convey ideas at the end of the day.</p>
						<p>This goes back to our central theme of changing education to fit the needs of current
							students; we have to analyze the types of writing that students are most comfortable with,
							and build off of that when designing curriculum that will truly resonate with them.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<h2 class="major">Write Less, Say More</h2>
						<p>Knowing this, it's important to consider the importance of writing short pieces in today's
							day and age. Our limitless access to information is a double bladed sword; it's also reduced
							our attention spans to the point where we don't really stick with any piece of writing that
							we deem 'too long'. In that sense, our society has placed a value upon brevity that we
							haven't really seen before.</p>
						<p>This mindset has been furthered by the nature of social media. For example, until recently,
							Twitter limited its users to 140 characters per each tweet; increasing it to a meager 280
							over the past few years. After spending so much time creating short Facebook status updates,
							Instagram posts, Tweets, and Snapchats, our generation has developed and practiced the
							unique skill of fitting as much information as one possibly can into a limited amount of
							characters. </p>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">

						<h2 class="major">Social Media in the ENGL101 Classroom</h2>
						<p>Social media is unique, in that most curriculums don't fully address it. After all, it's very
							difficult to encourage the use of something that can end up being so distracting in a
							learning environment. Many teachers and professors that I've had have simply rejected the
							use of social media in the classroom altogether, citing its detrimental effects on a
							learning environment to be too great to come close to being outweighed by the benefits.</p>
						<p>However, I feel that there are ways to integrate social media into English curriculum without
							encouraging the use of social media in the classroom outright.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>For example, we can allow students to display their aptitude for social media based
							communication with assignments that are reminiscent of social media. I believe effective
							ways we could provide this for students in ENGL101 would be like asking them to write witty
							Twitter posts that recap a current event, or to create a social media campaign for a certain
							cause that they care about (one of the many promising options that students can select in
							the remediation assignment). I feel like a great way to introduce these would be to provide
							them within the Public Remediation assignment, and as extensions to the Digital Forum.</p>

						writing. Fortunately, we have a fairly solid definition given to us in the first article in the
						recommened reading.</p>

					<blockquote>
						Digital writing, Kajder said, “is anything that involves the computer or some type of digital
						tool that’s going to allow you to hop online.”

					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>Digital writing is a fairly broad topic, and in that sense, we has educators have an

							that are available to them. Again, as mentioned in the quote to the left, digital writing
							can range from anywhere to a quick snapchat picture posted on your story, to a lengthy,
							heartfelt Facebook post, to anywhere in between. It's a new type of communication that we
							can, with some adjustment to our curriculae, allow students to accumulate a great amount of
							practice with. </p>
						<p>It's important to add that this is not a contained phenomenon. Digital writing is something

						<p>She had an idea that students were communicating with those in their own classes, in groups
							of '30 to 60'. What she didn't expect, was that students (at Pitt) were communicating with
							hundreds of others, working collaboratively to produce a variety of mediums through which
							they conveyed information, ranging from wikis to documents to infographics.</p>

					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>For the majority of this analysis, I have been advocating for rapid restructuring of certain
							portions of the ENGL101 curriculum, citing a need to move towards a more digital-friendly
							format. However, according to Miss Kajder, this may not be the best course of action.</p>
						<blockquote>
							Her first goal was to recognize that she shouldn’t change every assignment, but should start
							out with one per term. “I
							was going to start small and scale it up from that point and make sure that that worked
							well.”
						</blockquote>
						<p>Here, we can draw a parallel between Miss Kajder's advice and our own English curriculum. By
							slowly and gradually implementing assignments such as the Digital Forum &amp; the Public
							Remediation, we can test the waters and iteratively develop these assignments so that they
							provide the maximum benefit to our students.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>She also acknowledges the public audience in the same way that we acknowledge it while
							presenting our assignments.</p>
						<blockquote>those projects and pieces of work can have greater meaning and they actually become
							much more purposeful outside of the
							classroom space</blockquote>
						<p>It's important to note that, unlike a simple paper that will just be turned in, graded, and
							returned, this new type of published, publicly available product will be available to the
							rest of the web, to be used as a resource (as we explored earlier with the example in
							Section A).</p>
						<p>Her experience as a teacher and advice will surely be useful as we slowly but surely adjust
							our ENGL101 curriculum to suit the needs of increasingly digitally involved freshman class.

						<h2 class="major">Unique Perspective: Rights of the American People</h2>
						<p>Without a doubt, we as the American People enjoy a variety of liberties. With how easy it's
							become to share information with the world in today's day and age, it was just a matter of
							time before proposed legal framework was erected to maintain order and fairness within this
							new environment.</p>
						<p>If you'll refer to recommended reading article 2, you'll find a brave group of individuals
							looking to provide a bill of rights for digital learners. This pertains to our curriculum,
							as we are educators. As our roles transition from traditional writing instructors to digital
							writing/communication instructors to fit the era, we will be training the minds of tomorrow
							in the distribution of the wealth of information that they have to the general public.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>In that sense, I feel that it is just to ingrain these students with a sense of
							righteousness; in order to keep them ethically informed about the power they hold as
							educated distributors of information throught their own writing in the digital age.</p>
						<p>The article explores the provision of basic 'rights' to the people, including the right to
							access, privacy, public knowledge, and even financial transparency.</p>
						<p>It is important to note that given how easy it is to share information today, there is
							without a doubt plenty of room for exploitation of the masses. I believe that the main
							takeaway from this proposed Bill of Rights is that we should imbue our writing students with
							a certain sense of integrity, so that they use their knowledge and ultimately, their ability
							to share information in an ethical manner.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Digital Literacy and Wisdom</h2>
						<p>The internet can be used for many things, but we will focus on it here as a medium for
							productive discourse.</p>
						<p>My understanding is that, like what's described in recommended readings #3 and #4, there's a
							certain type of wisdom and literacy that we have to achieve and maintain in order to
							properly leverage this new and exciting resource.</p>
						<p>In general, we have to teach ourselves to interact online in the same way that we would
							politely interact in real life. Sometimes, the guise of anonymity might enable us to become
							more caustic; the instant response time and lack of foreseeable consequences may enable us
							to make logical mistakes. These, and all other quirks that accompany writing in the digital
							age are phenomena that we should recognize and deal with accordingly if we are to become
							successful writers in the digital age.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Teaching Writing in the Digital Age &amp; the ENGL101 Classroom</h2>
						<p>I would like to present a few tools here that Miss Sara Kajder from recommended reading #1
							suggested that I believe would be helpful in enhancing our current ENGL101 curriculum.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<h2 class="major">Videos: a New Way to Communicate</h2>
						<p>Videos are a fairly unexplored format for English classes, given that they differ so much
							from the classic English essay. However, we can't forget that the majority of the content
							today's students consume is probably from YouTube (and other streaming services) alone. The
							website is home to a variety of entertainment and lifestyle channels, but also facilitates a
							great many news personalities and educators: people who provide news and opinions in a
							format not unlike the writing that we put students to today.</p>
						<p>I believe that this format is worth exploring, and the tools that Miss Kajder suggests are a
							great way to break into that medium, at least, from a technical point of view.</p>

					</div>
				</div>


				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<ul>
							<p></p>
							<li><strong>Video Ant</strong> is a video annotation and mockup service that allows students
								to annotate videos in
								the same way that we have annotated textbook pages, articles, and essays. Videos are
								great informational means
								in their own right, and I believe it's about time we started providing formal
								instruction to students regarding
								how to annotate this way to communicate.</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>WeVideo</strong> is a video creation service that doesn't require any
									downloads. Unlike software such as IMovie or Windows Movie Maker, it's fully broswer
									based, making it much more accessible to all sorts of college students. I feel that
									it's equally important to have a means to create videos within the college classroom
									if you are going to be analyzing them, so I've included this selection of Miss
									Kajder as well.</p>
							</li>

						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content span-3">
						<p>In conclusion, teaching writing in the digital age is a difficult task. The appearance of new
							mediums that we haven't yet developed a lot of tried-and-true curriculum for has left us at
							at interesting crossroads. English curriculum can either adapt to encompass all these new
							ways to convey information, or it can remain as it always has, and risk being antiquated.
						</p>
						<p>I believe it is our job as educators to recognize that teaching writing in the digital age
							means that we will have to make significant changes to our curriculum. It is my hope that
							you look at all of these resources and come to your own conclusion; and with that, our last
							reflection question is to follow.</p>

								to keep an English education relevant and useful for our new freshman class. Feel free

								come up with ideas of your own.</h2>
